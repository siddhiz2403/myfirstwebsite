    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I am Siddhi Zambre, a final-year Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student driven by curiosity, adaptability, and the pursuit of excellence.

      With limited starting resources but limitless intent, I have worked on multiple real-world projects that span hardware and software domains — from radar-based rider safety to IoT-powered drainage systems. I may not know every tool at the start, but I have consistently learned whatever was needed to bring ideas to life.
